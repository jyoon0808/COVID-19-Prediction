# COVID-19-Prediction
Using Linear, Logistic, LSTM, GRU, and Prophet models

#Task1: 
We are going to divide the dataset into two parts: 80% of train_data and 20% of test_data. Then, we are going to train these data using different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, LSTM model, GRU model, and Prophet model(a model created by Facebook) to see which model has the greatest accuracy or lowest mean squared error. 

#Task2:
Now, we got the best model. By using the best fit model, we are going to forecast the date when the confirmed cases starts to decrease and the end date of the virus.

#Task3:
In this part, we are going to create an engine that calculates the probability of death of virus patient using logistic regression. The input features are age, gender, country, and province.
